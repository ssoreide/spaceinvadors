/**
 *	PROJECT - Finite State Machine support for Deterministic Finite Automata
 *
 *	FSM.h
 *	
 *	Refactored by Raman Molla <rmolla@dsic.upv.es>
 *
 *	HISTORY:
 *
 *	Adapted to be used by any kind of objects in any given program. It goes on using callbacks 
 *	but these calbacks have a new object parameter that provides the local information to execute 
 *	properly.
 *	The code have been doxygenated in order to imrpove the readability and support automatic documentation
 *	@version 11-2011
 *	Prefix: FSM_
